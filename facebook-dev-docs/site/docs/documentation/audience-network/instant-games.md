# Reporting API

Updated: Jun 30, 2026

Below is a guide for integrating the Audience Network Reporting API to access performance data for your apps.

## Prerequisites

* [A Meta App with the Facebook Login use case](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/development/create-an-app)
  and the `read_audience_network_insights` permission
* [Facebook Login in your app](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login)
* [A successful test query for a Graph API endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)
  and the `read_audience_network_insights` permission
* [Successful completion of Meta App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/resp-plat-initiatives/individual-processes/app-review)
* [A long-lived User Access Token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/get-long-lived)

### Recommendations

* When requesting large amounts of data,
  [cursor-based pagination](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results) is recommended. Paginated results are returned immediately for synchornous requests and is the preferred method for retrieving breakdowns.

### Limitations

* Dates always refer to PDT unless specifed otherwise
* Revenue metrics may not be available if the number of impressions is too small
  * If the data for is not available with a specific breakdown, we recommend querying the total for the time period
* User access tokens generated in Monetization Manager or Business Manager cannot be used
* Metrics are only reported when a minimum number of events has occurred. Some values may be approximate.

### Updates for Aggregation

#### Hourly aggregations are only available for 72 hours

We currently only return hourly aggregations for up to the past 72 hours. After, you may need to request for total or daily aggregations.

#### Daily aggregations may take longer to be come available

Hourly aggregations may be available before daily. It make take up to a few hours after the end of day (in PDT timezone) for daily aggregations to be available. In the meantime, you’re welcome to use hourly aggregations or visit MoMa for latest available data. Data between hourly and daily is always subject to small adjusments.

#### Daily Impressions and Revenue

Query impressions and revenue for the placement on 1-4 May 2022 with a daily breakdown.

What might change:
You may see that some data is unavailable following the change.
![Table comparing daily impressions and revenue before and after the change, with revenue shown as n/a on low-impression days](https://scontent.fdel27-8.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/672352908_1484143110111005_4647868223536371018_n.png?_nc_cat=111&_nc_map=urlgen_bucketless&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=lUYCewnCIssQ7kNvwHq0zn9&_nc_oc=AdqGPwiBBTEwdzX1UMtD55nhB2Z-PvGh3tjxsD0X1x0fPxkLdWxgoo-8gl_UDoTd3uIMthdHPE7wVnZezMh1Bu95&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel27-8.fna&_nc_gid=E4voattYW3IU_LKYXeJ4Rg&_nc_ss=7b289&oh=00_AQDNcr0GPMg-ukPfT4WXZlGPOFr6oidQjHaJpnwR4IzfEA&oe=6A60A3BF)

The revenue and CPM data points that are not available due to insufficient number of impressions will not be included in the `results` field in the API response. Instead, the corresponding entries will be added to the `omitted_results` field. They will include the time, metric and breakdowns fields, but they will not include the value - please refer to the sample response at the bottom of this page.

## Request Syntax

Use the GET
[ID > adnetworkanalytics](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/business/adnetworkanalytics)
endpoint to get audience network insights for a business, property, or app.

```
GET /<ID>/adnetworkanalytics
```

### Example GET Request

To get insights, send a `GET` request to the `/<ID>/adnetworkanalytics` endpoint with a comma-separated list of metrics and optional comma-separated list of breakdowns where `<ID>` is your Meta business ID, property ID, or app ID. The following example gets metrics over a single 24 hour period and limiting the results to 2 responses per metric.

*Formatted for readability. Be sure to replace bold and italics placeholder values with your values.*

```
curl -X GET https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/BUSINESS_ID/adnetworkanalytics
      ?metrics=["fb_ad_network_request","fb_ad_network_imp","fb_ad_network_click","fb_ad_network_revenue"]
      &breakdowns=["placement","country"]
      &since=2021-08-06
      &until=2021-08-06
      &limit=2
```

## Troubleshooting

### Access Token Debugger

Use the
[Access Token Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/) to get detailed information for an access token, including permissions, validity, property access, and App ID associated with the token.

### Error Messages

| Error Message / Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Expired Token | For best user experience, use [Long-Lived Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/get-long-lived) |
| “Facebook has detected that [your app] isn’t using a secure connection to transfer information error when using `read_audience_network_insights` scope.” | Ensure that your Business has been onboarded in [Monetization Manager⁠](https://business.facebook.com/pub/home/?business_id=100764642000645) and you have created at least one property. |
| “Reading insights of a Page, business, app, domain or event source group not owned by the querying user or application.” | Review Business Settings to make sure that you are requesting data owned by the Business that you are querying for. |
| “Unsupported `GET` request. Object with ID X does not exist, cannot be loaded due to missing permissions, or does not support this operation. Read the [Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api).” | Review the property to make sure that you are requesting data for a property you own. |
| “The way to access reporting API v2.0 has changed. You now need to implement Facebook Login for your app to access this API. See instructions here: /documentation/facebook-login” | You have tried to query the Reporting API v2 with the System User token. Use Facebook Login to make queries, or revert to v1 (but you will need to implement Facebook Login anyway in the future). |
| “Bad arg: All applications should have a property” | Ensure that your Business has been onboarded in [Monetization Manager⁠](https://business.facebook.com/pub/home/?business_id=100764642000645) and you have created at least one property. |
| "”Please reduce the amount of data you’re asking for, then retry your request.” | * If you are using the `day` or `hour` [aggregation period](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/audience-network/instant-games#aggregation-period), set a lower value for the [limit](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/audience-network/instant-games#limit) parameter. * If you are using the `total` aggregation period, reduce the duration of the date range specified by the [since/until](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/audience-network/instant-games#since-until) parameters. |
| “You can have at most 250 queries per minute” | Reporting API V2 allows requests with multiple parameters and the use of pagination. Please look into ways of using less API requests where possible. |
