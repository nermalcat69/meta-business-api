# Custom Audience Users

Updated: Oct 8, 2025

Add people to your ad's audience with a hash of data from your business. See [Custom Audiences from CRM Data](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences).

**You can add an unlimited number of records for an audience, but only a maximum of 10000 at a time. Changes to your Custom Audiences don't happen immediately and usually take up to 24 hours.**

### Flagged custom and lookalike audiences

If the audience is flagged with an `operation_status` of `471`, you must resolve the restrictions on the customer file custom audience before you can update or delete the user memberships. Attempts to edit user memberships without resolving the restrictions will result in an error.
