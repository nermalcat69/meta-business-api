## Creating

If you are copying an adset that already finished, the copy will be scheduled to start at the creation's time with the same duration of the original adset.

### Asynchronous

This endpoint supports [asynchronous batch requests](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/asynchronous-batch-requests), which enables you to send up to 50 requests in a single HTTP request. If you want to copy large amount of objects, you should use asynchronous batch request. To do so, set `deep_copy` to `true`, and you can copy the adset and all of its ads in one sub-request. For example if you have two adsets and each of them has 50 ads, you can copy 2 adsets and all their ads:

```
curl -F 'access_token=...'\
-F 'asyncbatch=[{ "method":"POST", "relative_url":"<ad-set-id>/copies","name":"async_copy1", body":"name=copy_adset_1&deep_copy=true" },{ "method":"POST", "relative_url":"<ad-set-id>/copies","name":"async_copy2", body": "name=copy_adset_2&deep_copy=true"}]' \
https://graph.facebook.com/<VERSION>
```

### Targeting DSA Regulated Locations (European Union)

### /{ad\_set\_id}/copies

You can make a POST request to *copies* edge from the following paths:

* [/{ad\_set\_id}/copies](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign/copies)

When posting to this edge, an [AdSet](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign) will be created.

| `status_option` *enum {ACTIVE, PAUSED, INHERITED\_FROM\_SOURCE}* | **Default value:** `PAUSED`  `ACTIVE`: the copied adset will have active status. `PAUSED`: the copied adset will have paused status. `INHERITED_FROM_SOURCE`: the copied adset will have the status from the original set. |

#### Return Type
