# Live Video API

Updated: Oct 8, 2025

The overlay\_url field on the [GET /<LIVE\_VIDEO\_ID>](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/live-video#fields) endpoint has been removed for v24.0+. It will continue to return null for v23.0 and older requests.

The Live Video API from Meta shows you how to steam live video to Facebook, create backup streams, crosspost to other profiles or pages, interact with viewers, and more.

On June 10th, 2024, Meta is launching new requirements that must meet before an account can go live on Facebook. The new requirements are as follows:

* The Facebook account must be at least 60 days old
* The Facebook Page or [professional mode profile⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2680340558863560) must have at least 100 followers
