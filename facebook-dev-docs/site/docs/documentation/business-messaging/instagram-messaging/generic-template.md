# Send a Message

Updated: Jun 24, 2026

This document contains the requirements for sending freeform messages from your Instagram Professional account to your customers or people interested in your account using the Messenger Platform from Meta.

**Note:** If your app users don't have a Facebook Page linked to their Instagram professional account, learn more about building an app with [the Instagram API with Instagram Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/platform/instagram-api).

You can send a freeform message that contains:

* one or more images, a video, or an audio file
* a reaction or sticker
* text, including a link

## Before you start

This guide assumes you have read the [Messenger Platform Overview](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/overview) and implemented the needed components such as a Facebook Page linked to your Instagram Professional account (or test Page), registered as a Meta developer, and created a Business App ID with the Messenger > Instagram Messaging product in the App Dashboard.

You may also want to check the [status of the Meta Developer Platform⁠](https://metastatus.com/#developerplatform) to ensure there are no issues.

### Requirements

* The ID for the Facebook Page linked to your Instagram Professional account
* The Instagram-scoped ID for customer who sent your business a message
* A Page access token requested from a person who can perform the `MESSAGE` task on the Facebook Page linked to your Instagram Professional account
* The `instagram_manage_messages` permission

### Limitations

* Apps with Standard Access can only send messages to people that have a role on the app
* Text message must be less than 1000 characters
* Media attachments can be:

| Media Type | Supported Format | Supported Size Maximum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audio | aac, m4a, wav, mp4 | 25MB |
| Image | png, jpeg | 8MB |
| Video | mp4, ogg, avi, mov, webm | 25MB |
| File | pdf | 25MB |

For more information about media attachments, see [Upload Media for Instagram Messaging](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/instagram-messaging/features/attachment-upload).

## Send a basic message

To send a message that contains text or a link, send a `POST` request to the `/PAGE-ID/messages` endpoint with the `recipient` parameter containing the Instagram-scoped ID (IGSID) and the `message` parameter containing the text or link.

Message text must be UTF-8 and be 1,000 bytes or less. Links must be valid formatted URLs.

### Sample request

*Formatted for readability.*

```
curl -i -X POST \  
  "https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/me/messages?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \  
  --data 'recipient={"id":"IGSID"}&message={"text":"TEXT-OR-LINK"}'
```

**Sample API response**

Upon success, your app receives the following JSON response:

```
{  
  "recipient_id": "IGSID",  
  "message_id": "MESSAGE-ID"  
}
```

## Send an image

To send an image, send a `POST` request to the `/me/messages` endpoint with the `recipient` parameter containing the Instagram-scoped ID (`<IGSID>`) and the `message` parameter containing up to ten `attachment` objects with `type` set to `image` and `payload` containing `url` set to the URL for the image.

### Sample request: Sending one image

*Formatted for readability.*

```
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/me/messages?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \  
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
     -d '{  
           "recipient":{  
               "id":"<IGSID>"  
           },  
           "message":{  
              "attachment": {  
                 "type":"image",  
                 "payload":{  
                   "url":"<IMAGE_URL>"  
                 }  
              }  
           }  
         }'
```

### Sample request: Sending multiple images with image URL

*Formatted for readability.*

```
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/me/messages?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \  
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
     -d '{  
           "recipient":{  
               "id":"<IGSID>"  
           },  
           "message":{  
              "attachments":[  
                 {  
                   "type":"image",  
                   "payload":{  
                     "url":"<IMAGE_URL>"  
                   }  
                 },  
                 {  
                   "type":"image",  
                   "payload":{  
                     "url":"<IMAGE_URL>"  
                   }  
                 },  
                 {  
                    ...  
                 }  
              ]  
           }  
         }'
```

### Sample request: Sending multiple images with attachment ID

The same images can be uploaded using the [Attachment Upload API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/instagram-messaging/features/attachment-upload) and sent to many different users to avoid the delays and timeouts of uploading multiple high-resolution images. You can also mix both `url` and `attachment_id` parameters in the `payload`.

*Formatted for readability.*

```
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/me/messages?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \  
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
     -d '{  
           "recipient":{  
               "id":"<IGSID>"  
           },  
           "message":{  
              "attachments":[  
                 {  
                   "type":"image",  
                   "payload":{  
                     "attachment_id":"<attachment_ID>"  
                   }  
                 },  
                 {  
                   "type":"image",  
                   "payload":{  
                     "attachment_id":"<attachment_ID>"  
                   }  
                 },  
                 {  
                    ...  
                 }
