# Media upload components

Updated: Apr 15, 2026

WhatsApp does not guarantee that data (such as images, videos, or documents) shared with you by your customers is non-malicious. Make sure to implement appropriate risk mitigations when processing such data (for example, using well-tested and up-to-date media and document processing libraries).

## Flow JSON components

Two components can be used to ask users to upload media:

* PhotoPicker: allows uploading media from camera or gallery
* DocumentPicker: allows uploading media from files or gallery

## PhotoPicker

Supported starting with Flow JSON version 4.0.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` **(required)** *string* | PhotoPicker |
| `name` **(required)** *string* | Component’s name. Must be distinct among all components on a screen. |
| `label` **(required)** *string* | Header text for the component.  Dynamic "${data.label}" OR "${screen.<screen\_id>.data.label}"  Max length: 80 characters |
| `description` *string* | Body text for the component.  Dynamic "${data.description}" OR "${screen.<screen\_id>.data.description}"  Max length: 300 characters |
| `photo-source` *enum* | Specifies the source where the image can be selected from.  Values: {'camera\_gallery', 'camera', 'gallery'}  Default: 'camera\_gallery'  * camera\_gallery: user can select from gallery or take a photo * gallery: user can select only from gallery * camera: user can only take a photo |
| `max-file-size-kb` *Integer* | Specifies the maximum file size (in kibibytes) that can be uploaded.  Default value: 25600 (25 MiB)   Allowed range: [1, 25600] |
| `min-uploaded-photos` *Integer* | Specifies the minimum number of photos that are required.  This property determines whether the component is optional (set to 0) or required (set above 0).  Default value: 0   Allowed range: [0, 30]  Note: Above limits apply if media files are sent to the endpoint via "data\_exchange" action. For images or documents sent as part of the response message, no more than 10 files can be attached. Additionally, the aggregated size of them cannot exceed 100 MiB. |
| `max-uploaded-photos` *Integer* | Specifies the maximum number of photos that can be uploaded.  Default value: 30   Allowed range: [1, 30]  Note: Above limits apply if media files are sent to the endpoint via "data\_exchange" action. For images or documents sent as part of the response message, no more than 10 files can be attached. Additionally, the aggregated size of them cannot exceed 100 MiB. |
| `enabled` *Boolean | String* | Specifies if user interaction is enabled on the component (true = enabled, false = disabled).  Dynamic "${data.is\_enabled}" OR "${screen.<screen\_id>.data.is\_enabled}"  Default: true |
| `visible` *Boolean | String* | Specifies if the component is visible on the screen (true = visible, false = hidden).  Dynamic "${data.is\_visible}" OR ${screen.<screen\_id>.data.visible}"  Default: true |
| `error-message` *String | Object* | Specifies errors when processing the images.  Dynamic “${data.error\_message}”   * String: specifies a generic error for the whole component. * Object: specifies image specific errors. Only use with dynamic data as media id must be supplied.   The format for Object is the following:  {"media\_id\_1" : "error\_message 1", "media\_id\_2" : "error\_message 2"}  Check the [endpoint handling](#endpoint-media-handling) section below to find out more about the media ids. |

### Limitations and restrictions

The table below outlines the constraints associated with the PhotoPicker component.

## Handling media

### Endpoint

Media uploaded by the users is temporarily (up to 20 days) stored in WhatsApp CDN. Files are encrypted using AES256-CBC+HMAC-SHA256+pkcs7 cryptographic algorithms.

In your endpoint implementation, you must download, decrypt, and validate each media file.

Here’s a payload example for a photo or document.

```
```
"photo_picker":[{  
     "media_id": "790aba14-5f4a-4dbd-aa9e-0d75401da14b",  
     "cdn_url": "https://mmg.whatsapp.net/v/redacted",  
     "file_name": "IMG_5237.jpg"  
     "encryption_metadata": {  
       "encrypted_hash": "/QvkBvpBED2q2AHPIFuhXfLpkn22zj2kO6ggzjvhHv0=",  
       "iv": "5SHjLrrsfPXTSJTcbrVSkg==",  
       "encryption_key": "lPa4SXcWbk3sy2so3OxjyXmpV4aE6CcIKd+4byr5hBw=",  
       "hmac_key": "15l+E9Z5gcL15WH9OQ8GgK7VVCKkfbVigoSiM9djvGU=",  
       "plaintext_hash": "AOF2dHXVEpm9efk9udNy3R1cUJWnpjFwQKGBEdALqXI="  
     }]
```
```

#### Decrypting and validating media

The files stored in WhatsApp CDN contain the encrypted media and the first 10 bytes of the HMAC-SHA256 (concatenated at the end). For reference, `cdn_file = ciphertext & hmac10`.

Perform the following steps to decrypt the media:

* Download `cdn_file` file from `cdn_url`
* Make sure SHA256(`cdn_file`) == `enc_hash`
* Validate HMAC-SHA256
  * Calculate HMAC with `hmac_key`, initialization vector (`encryption_metadata.iv`) and ciphertext
  * Make sure first 10 bytes == `hmac10`
* Decrypt media content
  * Run AES with CBC mode and initialization vector (`encryption_metadata.iv`) on ciphertext
  * Remove padding (AES256 uses blocks of 16 bytes, padding algorithm is pkcs7). Call this `decrypted_media`
* Validate the decrypted media
  * Make sure SHA256(`decrypted_media`) = `plaintext_hash`

## Response message (Cloud API)

Media can be received in the [response message webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/flows/guides/receiveflowresponse).

Here’s a truncated example using PhotoPicker (same structure for DocumentPicker)

```
```
{  
    "nfm_reply": {  
        // [... redacted ... ]  
        "response_json": {  
            "photo_picker": [  
                {  
                    "file_name": "IMG_5237.jpg",  
                    "mime_type": "image/jpeg",  
                    "sha256": "PqHgadp8cJ/N6mvAYGNMxhs9Ra5hbZFcctCtCClXsMU=",  
                    "id": "3631120727156756"  
                }  
            ],  
            "flow_token": "xyz",  
            "name": "John"  
        }  
    }  
}
```
```

The media can be downloaded following the same [steps as for regular image and document messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#download-media).
