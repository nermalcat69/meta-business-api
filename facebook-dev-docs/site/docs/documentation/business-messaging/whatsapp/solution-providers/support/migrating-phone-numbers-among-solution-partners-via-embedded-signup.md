## Troubleshooting

### Onboarded clients can’t send messages

There may be situations where clients can’t send messages after completing the Embedded Signup flow. The following checks may help resolve this issue:

* Verify that a valid payment method is attached to the WhatsApp Business account. If there isn’t a payment method attached (either a credit line for clients onboarded via a Solution Partner, or a credit card for clients onboarded via a Tech Provider or Tech Partner), the client will be unable to send template messages.
* Check if a different business phone number was registered as part of the onboarding process. If a different number was registered, you must register the problematic number for use with Cloud API.
* Check if the WhatsApp Business account has been disabled. WhatsApp Business accounts that violate our policies are automatically disabled, so this may be the reason.
