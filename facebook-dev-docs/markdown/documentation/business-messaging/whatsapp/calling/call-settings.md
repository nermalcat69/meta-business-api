## Value proposition (detailed)

The WhatsApp Business Calling API allows businesses to integrate voice and video\* calling directly into their customer engagement strategy, offering a trusted, unified, and feature-rich communication channel.

| Feature | Benefit for your business |
| --- | --- |
| **Unified communication** | **One number for all communication.** Use a single, verified WhatsApp number for all messaging and calling (inbound and outbound), and switch between chat and call, including chatting while on a call. |
| **Branding and trust** | **Built-in brand identity and verification.** WhatsApp has native support for brand identity with security and verification, which applies globally and eliminates the need for region-specific third-party trust providers. |
| **Customer relationship** | **A single point of contact for customers.** A single point of contact for both inbound and outbound communication supports ongoing customer relationships. |
| **Sales and support** | **Unify marketing and support channels.** Centralize lead management by unifying support and marketing channels, which streamlines operations and supports product upsell and cross-sell. |
| **Rich features** | **Video\*, screen sharing\*, and call controls.** Beyond voice, businesses can engage customers with video calls and screen sharing for richer, more detailed support and service. Businesses also control the calling experience by configuring calling hours, managing call icon visibility, sending call buttons with expiry, and using call deep links. |
| **Call deflection** | **Move calls to WhatsApp to improve deflection rates.** By moving calls to WhatsApp, businesses can direct customers to chat, using interactive messaging templates to improve deflection and reduce voice-only support costs. |
| **Customer convenience** | **Free and globally accessible for customers.** Offer your customers a globally accessible communication method that is free for them to use. |
| **Record keeping** | **One thread with a centralized, long-term record.** Maintain a single, persistent thread of all text and voice communications with the customer, serving as a centralized, long-term record for reference. |

**Note:**\* Feature planned or in development. Reach out to your Meta or partner for more details.

## Get started

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you get started with the Calling API, ensure that:

* [Your business number is in use with Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers) (not the WhatsApp Business app).
* Subscribe your app to the `calls` webhook field (unless you plan to use [SIP](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip)).
* The same app should also be [subscribed to the WhatsApp Business account](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/create-webhook-endpoint#configure-webhooks) of your business phone number.
* This app should have messaging permissions (`whatsapp_business_messaging`) for the business number.
* The business must have a daily [messaging limit](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits) of at least 2,000 unique recipients. More details on [scaling your account capabilities⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/595597942906808).
* [Enable Calling features on your business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings).

### Step 2: Configure calling features

The WhatsApp Business Calling API offers a number of features that affect when and how calling features appear to users on your WhatsApp profile.

* Inbound call control allows you to prevent users from placing calls from your business profile
* Business call hours allows you to avoid missed calls and direct users to message when your call center is closed
* Callback requests offer users the option to request a callback when you don’t pick up a call or if your call center is closed

[Learn more about call control settings](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings#parameter-details)

### Step 3: Make and receive calls

You can test your WhatsApp Calling integration using public test numbers and a sandbox WhatsApp Business account.

[Learn more about testing your WhatsApp Calling API integration](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling#testing-and-sandbox-accounts)

Cloud API Calling offers two call initiation paths:

* **User-initiated calls:** Calls that are made from a WhatsApp user to your business
* **Business-initiated calls:** Calls that are made from your business to a WhatsApp user

## Testing and sandbox accounts

Sandbox accounts are only available to Tech Partners.

[Sandbox accounts](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sandbox) and public test numbers enable you to test your WhatsApp Calling API integration with relaxed calling limitations.
Specifically, business-initiated calling limits are relaxed for sandbox accounts and public test numbers to help integration and testing efforts.

### Limits (per business + WhatsApp user pair)

* Sandbox accounts can send **25 call permissions per day** and **100 per week** (compared to 1 per day and 2 per week for production accounts)
* When business-initiated calls go unanswered or are rejected
  * **5 consecutive unanswered calls** result in a system message to reconsider an approved permission (compared to 2 consecutive unanswered calls for production accounts)
  * **10 consecutive unanswered calls** result in an approved permission being automatically revoked (compared to 4 consecutive unanswered calls for production accounts).

You obtain a public test number after completing the [Get Started flow](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/get-started).

Your business isn’t required to have a daily [messaging limit](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits) of 2,000 unique recipients to test Calling API features when using public test numbers and Sandbox accounts.

Calling is disabled by default on test numbers. You must [configure calling features in phone number call settings](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings#configure-call-settings) before using the Calling API on a test number.

[Learn more about sandbox accounts for calling](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/overview#sandbox-accounts)

## Availability
