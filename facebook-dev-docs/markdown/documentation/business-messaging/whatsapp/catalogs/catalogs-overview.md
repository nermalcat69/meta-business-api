# Groups API FAQ

Updated: May 21, 2026

### What happens when I delete a group?

* No members, including you, will be able to message the group.
* Cloud API delivers any messages or statuses it received before you deleted the group, so you may still receive webhooks for those messages or statuses.

### Why can’t a participant join the group using my invite link?

Some possible reasons include:

* The invite link might have been deleted.
* You removed the participant from the group previously.
* The group is already full.

### How can I send my invite link to users?

* You can send the invite link over a 1:1 conversation.
* A new utility template is available in the [Template Library⁠](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/template-library) to [send group invite links](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/groups/reference#send-group-invite-link-template-message).
* You can also create custom, free-form marketing templates.

### What countries is Groups available in?

* Groups is available in [all countries Cloud API is available in](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support#country-restrictions).
