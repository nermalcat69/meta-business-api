# Partner-led Business Verification

Updated: May 21, 2026

This feature is currently only available to approved **Select Solution** and **Premier** Solution Partners. See our [Sign up for partner-led business verification⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1091073752691122) Help Center article to learn how to request approval.

This document describes how to create business verification submissions for clients who have been onboarded via Embedded Signup.

If you are an approved Solution Partner, you can gather required business verification documentation from your onboarded clients and submit their business for verification on their behalf. Decisions on submissions created in this way can be made in minutes instead of days.

## Requirements

* You must already be an approved **Select Solution** or **Premier** Solution Partner, and [approved for access⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1091073752691122)
* Your [system user access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens#system-user-access-tokens)
* The system user whose system token you are using must be an admin on your business portfolio (see our [About business portfolio access⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606) Help Center article)
* The system user whose system token you are using must have granted your app the **business\_management** permission
* The client’s business portfolio ID ([provided by the client⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1181250022022158?id=180505742745347) or returned via API by requesting the `owner_business_info` field on the client’s WABA ID, using their [business token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens#business-integration-system-user-access-tokens))

## Limitations

You are limited to three submissions for a given client. If all three submissions are rejected, the client must complete business verification on their own. If your submission is rejected three times, share the following Help Center article with the client:

## Turnaround time

The average turnaround time for a submission is 5 minutes, but can take several hours. If you do not receive a webhook notifying of the outcome of a submission after 24 hours, please open a Direct Support ticket.

## Webhooks

Submission decisions are communicated via **account\_update** webhook, so make sure your app is subscribed to the **account\_update** webhook field, and your app is [subscribed to webhooks on the client’s WhatsApp Business account](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/manage-webhooks#subscribe-to-a-whatsapp-business-account).
