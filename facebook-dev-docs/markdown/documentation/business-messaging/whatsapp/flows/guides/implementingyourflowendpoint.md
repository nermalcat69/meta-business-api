## Terminology

**Flows**: Represents a use case or workflow that a business offers to users. For example, “Book an appointment”. A Flow consists of screens, components (such as input fields), assets such as graphics), and (optionally) an endpoint for data-driven interactions.

**Flow JSON**: Flow JSON is used to programmatically define Flows.

**Components**: Individual building blocks that make up a screen (text fields, buttons, and so on).

**Screens**: A collection of Components on a single screen, defined in Flow JSON.

**Endpoint**: Communication channel created to exchange data between WhatsApp screens and the business server that processes data from each screen. Based on the business logic, the channel is then used to respond back with data to render the next screen in the workflow.
