*Messenger Platform*

Added the [image grid template](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/image-grid), a new [message template](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/send-messages/templates) that displays 2 to 6 images arranged in a grid within a single message. Each image can have its own tap action that opens a URL (`web_url`) or sends a postback to your webhook (`postback`), and you can add an optional title, subtitle, and up to three buttons below the grid.

### Sticker API for Messenger Platform

Use the [Sticker API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/send-messages/sticker-api) to browse, search, and send first-party stickers through the Messenger Platform API.

**New endpoints:**

* `GET /sticker_packs` — List available sticker packs with name, description, preview image, and sticker count.
* `GET /sticker_packs/<STICKER_PACK_ID>/stickers` — List stickers within a specific pack, including id, name, image URL, and dimensions.
* `GET /sticker_search?q=<QUERY>` — Search stickers by keyword across all available packs. Supports multilingual search with the `locale` parameter using a [supported locale](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/messenger-profile/supported-locales) code (for example, `locale=vi_VN` for Vietnamese or `locale=ko_KR` for Korean). Defaults to `en_US`.

**Send stickers:**

Use the [Send Messages API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/send-messages/) to send a sticker with the `sticker_id` field:

```
```
{  
  "recipient": {"id": "<PSID>"},  
  "message": {"sticker_id": 767226160478561}  
}
```
```

**Webhook change with sticker attachment type (90-day transition):**

Sticker messages in [webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/webhooks/) now include a new `type: "sticker"` attachment with `sticker_id` metadata, alongside the existing `type: "image"` attachment. During the 90-day transition period (until August 30, 2026), both attachment types are present in the payload. After the transition, only the `sticker` attachment type will be sent.

Update your webhook handlers to recognize the `sticker` attachment type before August 30, 2026. The same change applies to message echoes and Conversations API responses.

**Required permissions:** The catalog and search endpoints require an app access token (no additional permissions). Sending stickers requires `pages_messaging`.

The legacy `share` attachment type is being removed from Instagram post share webhook payloads. As announced on [October 30, 2025](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform#october-30--2025), the `share` attachment has been deprecated in favor of the `ig_post` attachment type, which includes full metadata (media ID, URL, and title). This change is being rolled out gradually: webhooks will return only the `ig_post` attachment once rollout reaches your app. If your integration still relies on the `share` attachment type for Instagram posts, update it to use `ig_post` instead or contact our developer support team through [Meta Developer Support Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/support/) to request exclusion of your app(s) from this change.

The Instagram Direct Send API now supports sending the images with attachment IDs (in addition to image URLs) which resolves the problem of timeouts when uploading multiple large high-quality images from slow servers.

Business Suite.

  webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/reference/webhook-events/messages#message-with-appointment-booking) payload includes the appointment data as an attachment with type
  `appointment_booking`.
* **Message Echoes Webhook** — When a business responds to an appointment (e.g., confirming or declining), the [message\_echoes
  webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/reference/webhook-events/message-echoes#appointment) payload includes the updated appointment data.

Starting November 3, 2025, the webhook payload for Instagram post shares will include two attachments: the existing `share` attachment and a new `ig_post` attachment. The payload now provides additional metadata, including media ID, URL, and title (caption).

If this change is not compatible with your app and you need more time to make updates, please contact our developer support team via the [Meta Developer Support Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/support/) to request exclusion of your app(s) from this change until you make the necessary updates to support the new attachment type.

The old `share` attachment type will continue to be supported for Instagram posts until **February 1, 2026**, after which it will be removed. Partners and integrators are encouraged to migrate to the new `ig_post` attachment type as soon as possible.

#### Business Login for Instagram

[Business Login for Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/business-login-for-instagram) makes it easier for you to onboard Instagram users who still need to configure their account for API access through modal pop ups and fewer steps.

#### Improvements between Click to Messenger, Lead Gen ads and Messenger Platform

We’ve made following up on Lead Gen ads that Click to Messenger easier through:

* A new [Referral Webhook for Click to Messenger, Lead Gen ads](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/discovery/lead-generation-ads-in-messenger#webhooks) that include the lead information.
* Improvements to the [Handover Protocol](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/handover-protocol/messenger-lead-ads-hop). Advertisers can now select which app they want to route completed leads. Additionally, for apps that haven’t yet implemented these app notifications, an [optional summary message](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/discovery/lead-generation-ads-in-messenger#connnectapp) can be enabled, to send lead information to that app in the form of a regular message.
* Since referral or summary events are triggered while the standard messaging window is open, apps can use this to follow-up with leads directly in Messenger, upsell them to [Recurring Notifications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/recurring-notifications) or have them book an appointment or call the business directly.

#### Messaging Events API

Messaging Events API supports the [`lead_submitted` event](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/conversions-api/business-messaging#lead_submitted). Businesses can use this event to report lead submissions from Click to Messenger ads. This new messaging event is released as an Open Beta. Reporting in Ads Manager will come soon.

#### Persistent Menu

[Persistent Menu](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/instagram-messaging/features/persistent-menu) is now available for Instagram Messaging.

#### Private Replies

Instagram Messaging now supports [Private Replies](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/instagram-messaging/features/private-replies) for comments on Instagram Live Stories and ads posts. You may need to update your webhooks server to handle these new fields.

#### Recurring Notifications

You can now get a list of all valid Notification Message Tokens using the [`GET /PAGE-ID/notification_message_tokens` endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/recurring-notifications#get-a-list-of-tokens).

* `image_aspect_ratio` – Set an image to a horizontal or square aspect ratio for opt in requests
* `elements` – Create a carousel of images for opt in requests
* `notification_message_tokens` – Get a list of current notifications message tokens
