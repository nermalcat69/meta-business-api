    "type": "OAuthException",

| Code – Subcode | Message | Possible Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1` – `99` | An unknown error occurred. | Missing permissions can cause this issue.  Your app may need [Advanced Access, Business Verification, or permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/overview). |
| `1` – `1357046` | Received invalid JSON reply. | The developer is sending a batch of messages containing 2 text messages and 1 video. The messages are all sent successfully, but the endpoint returns an error. Is the object that they are sending causing the problem? There is a system delay in returning the error message. |
| `2` | An unexpected error has occurred. Please retry your request later. | When experiencing issues making calls to the Meta social graph, you can check the [status of the Meta Developer Platform⁠](https://metastatus.com/) to determine if there are issues affecting API calls. You might also receive this error if a customer has blocked your business from messaging him or her. |
| `2 – 2018344` | Service temporarily unavailable  Privacy ToS not accepted – To use the inbox label API, you need to accept the privacy ToS. Click the link to accept. https://www.facebook.com/100841475479486/inbox/page\_contact\_tos/ | The Page admin must accept the [Privacy Terms of Service for Custom Labels](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/policy). |
| `4` | Rate Limit error: Application request limit reached.  Rate Limit error: Too many send requests to phone numbers | Pause requests until current requests drop below the limit. |
| `4` – `2018354` | Marketing Messages – There has to be a minimum delay between 2 notifications for the given notification | When a Marketing Message bypasses the frequency set in the `notification_messages_frequency` field.  This error code will not cause your app to be flagged or blocked for abuse. It is okay to ignore this error, but ideally you should keep track of which users you have sent messages to per the agreed cadence, so you can exclude those users from the next batch of broadcast messages. |
| `9` – `2018352` | User is performing too many actions | When the Marketing Message opt–in request limit has been exceeded. |
| `10` | No Permission For Pages Associated to Instant Games. | The User Profile API is not available for PSIDs associated with Instant Game Pages. |
| `10` – `1404170` | Application does not have permission for this action | When the Page is temporarily restricted from sending Marketing Message opt–in requests. |

| `10` – `2018336` | User Thread Impact | To determine whether there is user thread impact, invoke the [User Level Menu API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/send-messages/persistent-menu). If you get a valid response, there is no impact. If you get an error message with code 10, subcode 2018336, the thread is impacted. |

Please try reconnecting or verify if the user needs 2–factor authentication. | The page and IG account are not linked or 2–factor authentication is not enabled.

There are different recovery tactics. The document provides a list of error values with a map to the most common recovery tactic to use.
* [Rate Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting) – A rate limit is the number of API calls an app or user can make within a given time period. If this limit is exceeded or if CPU or total time limits are exceeded, the app or user may be throttled. API requests made by a throttled user or app will fail.
