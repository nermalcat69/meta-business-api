# message\_deliveries Webhook Event Reference

Updated: Jun 21, 2022

This callback will occur when a message a Page has sent has been delivered. You can subscribe to this callback by selecting the `message_deliveries` field when [setting up](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/webhooks#setup) your webhook.

## Example

```
{
  "sender":{
    "id":"<PSID>"
  },
  "recipient":{
    "id":"<PAGE_ID>"
  },
   "delivery":{
      "mids":[
         "mid.1458668856218:ed81099e15d3f4f233"
      ],
      "watermark":1458668856253
   }
}
```

## Properties

### `sender`

| `sender` Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` *string* | The Page-scoped ID for the person who sent a message to your business |

### `recipient`

| `recipient` Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` *string* | The ID for your Facebook Page |

### `delivery`

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mids` | Array<String> | Array containing message IDs of messages that were delivered. Field may not be present. |
| `watermark` | Number | All messages that were sent before this timestamp were delivered |

Both `mids` and `watermark` fields are used to determine which messages were delivered. `watermark` is always present and `mids` is sometimes present. `mids` provides delivery receipts on a per-message basis but may not be present (due to backward compatibility reasons with older Messenger clients). `watermark` is always present and is a timestamp indicating that all messages with a timestamp before `watermark` were delivered.
