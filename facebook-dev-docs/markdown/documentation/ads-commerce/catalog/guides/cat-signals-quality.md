# Migrate to the /items\_batch Endpoint

Updated: Sep 12, 2025

This document will help you plan migration of your API integration from the legacy [/batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/batch) endpoint to its replacement the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint.

## Why You Should Migrate

* The [/batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/batch) endpoint is no longer maintained and will eventually be deprecated.
* The new [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint is more versatile and can handle all operations supported by the /batch endpoint.
* The new [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint has support for [category-specific fields](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/commerce-platform/catalog/categories).

## Differences Between the Endpoints

The [/batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/batch) and the new [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoints were designed, at different points in time, to solve the same problem. It is important to note the following differences between the two:

### Difference 1 - Additional item\_type parameter

Since the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint supports the concept of verticals, you are required to pass a value of the ‘item\_type’ parameter. If migrating from the /batch endpoint, you should always pass item\_type=PRODUCT\_ITEM.

### Difference 2 - Data for some fields is passed differently

| /batch | /items\_batch | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| retailer\_id | id | The /batch endpoint has product retailer\_id passed as part of a request object.  In the case of the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint, the corresponding ‘id’ field is part of the ‘data’ field of the request object (see example requests below). |
| price, currency | price | Price may need to be divided by 100 depending on the currency (see [this documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/currencies)). The currency code needs to be appended.  Example: `99.99 USD` |
| sale\_price | sale\_price | For passing the sale\_price value to the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint, the value from the /batch payload needs to be divided by 100 (depending on the currency, see [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/currencies)) and a currency code needs to be appended to it.  Example: `99.99 USD` |
| image\_url | image\_link | Same value, different field name |
| url | link | Same value, different field name |
| name | title | Same value, different field name |
| manufacturer\_part\_number | mpn | Same value, different field name |
| additional\_image\_urls | additional\_image\_link | Same value, different field name |
| category | google\_product\_category | Same value, different field name |
| shipping | shipping | Fields in the structures describing shipping are named differently.  | /batch | /items\_batch | | --- | --- | | country | shipping\_country | | price\_currency | shipping\_price\_currency | | price\_value | shipping\_price\_value | | region | shipping\_region | | service | shipping\_service |  Alternatively, the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint can handle shipping information passed as a single string consisting of comma-separated blobs (representing shipping options) in the following format: COUNTRY:STATE:SHIPPING\_TYPE:PRICE  Example: `US:CA:Ground:9.99 USD, US:NY:Air:15.99 USD` |
| additional\_variant\_attributes | additional\_variant\_attribute | The /batch endpoint expects this data to be passed as a label->value dictionary. The [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint expects this to be passed as an array of objects with two fields: variant\_label, variant\_value.  Example:  `[ {"variant_label": "a1", "variant_value": "v1}, {"variant_label": "a2", "variant_value": "v2} ]` |
| applinks | applink | The /batch endpoint expects app links to be passed as a dictionary where the key represents a platform name (such as ‘android’, ‘ios’, etc.) and the values are arrays of objects containing data related to the link. The same data should be passed to the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint as a flat object with the following fields:   * ios\_url * ios\_app\_store\_id * ios\_app\_name * iphone\_url * iphone\_app\_store\_id * iphone\_app\_name * ipad\_url * ipad\_app\_store\_id * ipad\_app\_name * android\_url * android\_package * android\_class * android\_app\_name * windows\_phone\_url * windows\_phone\_app\_id * windows\_phone\_app\_name |
| retailer\_product\_group\_id | item\_group\_id | Same value, different field name |
| sale\_price\_start\_date, sale\_price\_end\_date | sale\_price\_effective\_date | The /batch endpoint receives the start and end dates of a sale as two separate fields. The [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint requires them to be passed as a single string with two dates separated by a slash.  Example: `2014-11-01T12:00-0300/2014-12-01T00:00-0300` |

#### Example of Two Equivalent API Requests

| /batch | /items\_batch |
| --- | --- |
| ``` curl -i -X POST \   https://graph.facebook.com/<CATALOG_ID>/batch \   -F access_token=<TOKEN> \   -F 'requests=[       {           "method":"UPDATE",           "data":{               "retailer_product_group_id": "g1",               "price": 1400,               "currency": "GBP",               "image_url": "http://website.com/image4.jpg",               "additional_variant_attributes": {"Scent": "Fruity", "Flavor": "Apple"},               "applinks": {                  "android": [{                   "url": "a://b/c",                   "package": "android.topwidgets",                   "app_name": "TopWidgets"                  }],                  "ios": [{                   "url": "d://e/f",                   "app_store_id": 123456,                   "app_name": "TopWidgets"                  }]               },               "category": "543586",               "url": "http://website.com/product.html",               "manufacturer_part_number": "twp123",               "sale_price": 1100,               "shipping": [                {                    "country": "US",                    "region": "CA",                    "service": "Pick-up point",                    "price_value": "4.90",                    "price_currency": "USD"                },                {                    "country": "US",                    "region": "CA",                    "service": "Home delivery",                    "price_value": "7.90",                    "price_currency": "USD"                }                ],               "name": "Test Product Name",           },           "retailer_id": "legacy_batch_api_product_123",       }   ]' ``` | ``` curl -i -X POST \   https://graph.facebook.com/<CATALOG_ID>/items_batch \   -F access_token=<TOKEN> \   -F 'requests=[       {           "method":"UPDATE",           "data":{               "id": "batch_api_product_123",               "item_group_id": "g1",               "price": "14 GBP",               "image_link": "http://website.com/image4.jpg",               "additional_variant_attribute": "Scent:Fruity,Flavor:Apple",               "applink": {                   "android_url": "a://b/c",                   "android_package": "android.topwidgets",                   "android_app_name": "TopWidgets",                   "ios_url": "d://e/f",                   "ios_app_store_id": "123456",                   "ios_app_name": "TopWidgets"               },               "google_product_category": "543586",               "link": "http://website.com/product.html",               "mpn": "twp123",               "sale_price": "11 GBP",               "shipping": [       {         "shipping_country": "US",         "shipping_region": "CA",         "shipping_service": "Pick-up point",         "shipping_price_value": "4.90",         "shipping_price_currency": "USD"       },       {         "shipping_country": "US",         "shipping_region": "CA",         "shipping_service": "Home delivery",         "shipping_price_value": "7.90",         "shipping_price_currency": "USD"       }     ],               "title": "Test Product Name",           }       }   ]' \   -F item_type=PRODUCT_ITEM ``` |

### Difference 3 - /items\_batch warns about unsupported fields in the API response

The legacy /batch API endpoint ignores requests with unrecognized fields while the [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint issues a warning but still ingests the fields that it recognizes.

## Recommended Process for Migrating to the /items\_batch Endpoint

At a high level the process should include the following two steps:

* Implement the code necessary to pass all the necessary inputs to the items\_batch endpoint. While doing so, you should take the differences listed above into account.
* Gradually migrate your integration from the legacy /batch endpoint to the new [/items\_batch](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/items_batch) endpoint.

If you run into issues when carrying out the migration, please reach out to your business partner or reach out to Meta support.
